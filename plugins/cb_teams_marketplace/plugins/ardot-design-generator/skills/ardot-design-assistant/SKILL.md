# Ardot Design Assistant

Standard workflow for completing design tasks on `.ardot` files via the ardot MCP server. All canvas manipulation MUST go through ardot MCP tools.

## Reference Files

Load on demand based on task type:

| File | When to load |
|------|--------------|
| `../../rules/design-rules.md` | **Single source of truth** — editing principles, coordinates, flexbox, text, components, colors, variables, tables, images, effects, SVG, property schema, troubleshooting, post-generation validation |
| `../../rules/style-guide.md` | Visual style guide — typography, color, layout, surface treatment, variance levels, forbidden AI patterns, bento grid |
| `../../rules/style-guide-tags.md` | Static list of valid tags for `fetch_style_guide(tags)` — read this instead of calling `fetch_style_guide_tags` |
| `references/ardot-workflow.md` | End-to-end workflow examples (create, modify, global style update, tokens, form) and detailed operation syntax |
| `references/slides-workflow.md` | Slides / deck creation — 5-phase process (use when current model is **NOT** opus4.7) |
| `references/slides-agent-teams-workflow.md` | Slides / deck creation — Agent teams workflow (use when current model **IS** opus4.7; first ask the user whether to enable agent teams, clarifying that it takes more time and consumes more tokens — if yes, use this workflow; if no, fall back to `references/slides-workflow.md`) |
| `references/extract-style-guide-from-web.md` | Website → design guide extraction |
| `references/design-to-code-workflow.md` | Design → HTML/CSS/JS conversion, generate Application, to code, slide transitions, responsive scaling |
| `references/guidelines-landing-page.md` | Landing / marketing page |
| `references/guidelines-web-app.md` | Web app (default for generic design tasks) |
| `references/guidelines-mobile-app.md` | Mobile / app screen |
| `references/guidelines-slides.md` | Slide deck design rules (L01–L20, typography, visuals) |
| `references/guidelines-table.md` | Tables / dashboards with tables |
| `references/guidelines-code.md` | Design-to-code implementation |
| `references/guidelines-tailwind.md` | Tailwind v4 implementation (alongside `guidelines-code.md`) |

## Preparation: (IMPORTANT: Ensure a Design File Is Open)

Before any canvas operation, make sure an Ardot design file is loaded in the editor. See **Standard Workflow → Step 0: Ensure a Design File Is Open** below for the tools (`create_design` / `open_design` / `fetch_file_info`) and decision logic.

## Standard Workflow

### Step 0: Ensure a Design File Is Open

Before any canvas operation, make sure an Ardot design file is loaded in the editor:

- **`create_design`** — Create a new blank Ardot design file and open it in the editor. Optionally accepts a `fileName`. If the user wants to start from scratch or no existing file is mentioned, call this first.
- **`open_design`** — Open an existing Ardot design file by URL or file ID. Accepts a `fileUrl` parameter (e.g. `https://ardot.tencent.com/file/667788990055443` or bare ID `667788990055443`). If the user provides a file link or ID, call this to load it.
- **`fetch_file_info`** — Fetch the current loaded file ID, after `create_design` or `open_design` has been called to get the file ID.

**Decision logic**:
1. If the user explicitly provides a file URL or ID → call `open_design`.
2. If the user asks to create a new design / start fresh → call `create_design`.(optionally with the given 'fileName').
3. If the editor already has a file loaded (determined in Step 1) → skip this step.
4. If call `create_design` produces an empty canvas, **MAKE SURE SKIP** `fetch_editor_state` at any workflow, the default PageID is `0:1`, use it as the root container.

> ⛔ **Hard gate — do NOT issue any other MCP call until the file is ready.**
>
> After calling `create_design` or `open_design`, the file loads asynchronously. You MUST wait for the context update / ready confirmation before issuing **any** other MCP call.
>
> **Never** bundle `create_design` / `open_design` in the same parallel batch as `fetch_editor_state`, `fetch_variables`, or any other read — those reads will hit an empty or not-yet-loaded editor and return stale/empty state.
>
> Correct order (two separate messages):
> 1. Message 1: `create_design` or `open_design` → wait for ready signal.
> 2. Message 2: subsequent reads (Step 1) — may be parallel, see below.
>
> Exception: if Step 0 is skipped (a file is already loaded from a previous turn), Step 1 can be the first message of the turn.

### Step 1: Read Existing State (parallel, conditional)

Read whatever state is relevant to the task. **Issue all independent reads in a single message as parallel tool calls** — do not serialize them.

| Scenario | What to call | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Freshly created file (`create_design` just ran) | **nothing** | Empty canvas — root is `0:1`, no variables yet. Skip Step 1, go straight to Step 2. |
| Opened existing file / file already loaded | `fetch_editor_state({includeSchema: false})` + `fetch_variables` | Parallel in one message. |
| Pure modification (file already loaded, target known) | The above **plus** any of `batch_read` / `capture_layout` / `capture_screenshot` as needed | All parallel in one message. |

> **Do NOT call `fetch_style_guide_tags`.** The tag list is static — read `../../rules/style-guide-tags.md` instead.

### Step 2: Creative vs. Compositional

- **Creative** (new screen, page, dashboard, restyle) → proceed to Steps 3–4
- **Compositional** ("add a button", "move this") → skip to Step 5 and load `design-rules.md`

### Step 3: Load Design Guidelines

Load **one or more** design-type guideline, first match wins:

| Priority | Trigger | File |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | slides, presentation, deck, 幻灯片, 演示文稿 | `references/guidelines-slides.md` |
| 2 | mobile, app, iOS, Android, 移动端 | `references/guidelines-mobile-app.md` |
| 3 | landing, marketing, SaaS, 落地页, 营销 | `references/guidelines-landing-page.md` |
| 4 | table, dashboard with tables, 表格 | `references/guidelines-table.md` |
| 5 | convert to code, to App, HTML, 转代码, 出码, 生成应用，转应用 | `references/guidelines-code.md` (+ `guidelines-tailwind.md` if Tailwind) |
| 6 | (web app, default) | `references/guidelines-web-app.md` |

`guidelines-code.md` / `guidelines-tailwind.md` are implementation guidelines and can be loaded **alongside** a design-type guideline when code generation is involved.

### Steps 4–6: Style + Space + Inspection (parallel)

Issue these as **a single parallel batch** in one message — they have no mutual dependency:

- **`fetch_style_guide(tags)`** — pick 5–10 fitting tags from `../../rules/style-guide-tags.md` (see the Selection Guidance section there).
- **`locate_available_space({width, height})`** — required for new top-level screens; skip for pure modification tasks. Never overlap existing content.
- **Inspection calls** (only if modifying existing design and not already covered in Step 1): `batch_read` (find by pattern/ID, `readDepth: 3` for component structure), `capture_layout` (detect problems), `capture_screenshot` (visual verify).

Skip any sub-call that doesn't apply to the current task. The point of parallel batching is to collapse independent reads into one round-trip, not to force every tool to run.

> If a follow-up read depends on this batch's result (e.g. `batch_read({readDepth: 3})` targeting a component discovered via an earlier `batch_read`), issue it as a separate message afterward. Most tasks don't need that.

### Step 7: Execute Design

`batch_edit` with ≤ 25 ops per call. Build order: **structure → content → style → verify**. Ops: **I()** Insert, **U()** Update, **C()** Copy, **M()** Move, **D()** Delete, **G()** Image. For detailed syntax and examples, load `references/ardot-workflow.md`.

### Step 8: Validate

Follow the **Post-Generation Validation Pattern** in `design-rules.md`. Use **tiered validation** — pick the lightest check that matches what the batch changed (T1 structural → `capture_layout` only; T2 content → skip; T3 visual → `capture_screenshot` only; T4 section-complete → both once; T5 final page → one screenshot). **Do not run full dual-verification after every batch_edit.** Enforce the convergence threshold: **max 2 fix iterations per section**, ignore ≤4px spacing noise, no subjective re-polishing once the section matches spec.

## Specialized Workflows

When the task matches one of the following, load the linked reference and follow it strictly (do not improvise the procedure from SKILL.md):

- **Slides / presentation / deck** → choose workflow based on the current model. When the model is **opus4.7**, ask the user whether to use the agent teams workflow (clarify that it takes more time and consumes more tokens): if yes, use `references/slides-agent-teams-workflow.md`; if no, use `references/slides-workflow.md`. For other models, use `references/slides-workflow.md` directly. Mandatory design rules live in `references/guidelines-slides.md`.
- **Website → style guide extraction** → `references/extract-style-guide-from-web.md`
- **Design → frontend code** → `references/design-to-code-workflow.md`

## Essential Constraints

These rules apply at all times. Full rule set and troubleshooting are in `design-rules.md`.

- **Every node needs a `name`** — assign meaningful names to all created nodes
- **Keep float colors to 2 decimals** — avoid long floating-point values
- **Text is invisible by default** — always set `fill` on text nodes
- **Use `fill` for all colors** — never use `textColor`, `backgroundColor`, `color`, or `fillColor`
- **Use `cornerRadius`** — not `borderRadius`
- **Font weight must be numeric strings** — `"400"`, `"700"`, not `"bold"`
- **Alignment uses uppercase enums** — `counterAxisAlignItems: "CENTER"`, not `alignItems: "center"`
- **Prefer flexbox layout** — always set `width` and `height` on new frames explicitly
- **Layout default sizing is FIXED** — when setting `layout` to `horizontal`/`vertical`, must explicitly set `width`/`height` for dynamic sizing
- **x/y are ignored in flexbox** — if you need to set x/y on children of flexbox parents, also set `layoutPositioning: "ABSOLUTE"`
- **`fill_container` requires flexbox parent** — only valid when parent has layout
- **`hug_contents` requires own flexbox layout** — only valid on a node that itself has flexbox layout
- **Default frame has white background** — set `fills: []` to remove
- **Max 25 ops per batch_edit** — split by logical sections
- **Every I/C/R needs a binding name** — `document` is predefined for root only
- **No U() on copied descendants** — copied nodes get new IDs; use `descendants` in C() instead
- **No image node type** — images are fills on frames; use G() with `"stock"` preferred
- **Icon frames must set `layout: "none"`** — and always `capture_screenshot()` to verify
- **Create icons as components** — then use `I(parentId, {type: "ref", ref: "iconId"})` to insert instances
- **Variable binding uses `$` prefix** — `fill: "$primary-color"`, `gap: "$spacing-small"`
- **Favor copying + updating** over generating from scratch
- **Parallelize independent reads** — when multiple MCP read calls have no data dependency (e.g. `fetch_editor_state` + `fetch_variables`), issue them in a single message as parallel tool calls; do not serialize them. **Exception**: never bundle these reads in the same message as `create_design` / `open_design` — wait for the file-ready context update first
- **Validate with tiered checks** — match the tier to the batch type (see `design-rules.md` Post-Generation Validation Pattern); do NOT run full screenshot+layout after every batch_edit
- **Text wrapping needs both** — `textAutoResize: "HEIGHT"` AND `width: "fill_container"` (or fixed width)
- **`lineHeight`** — set `lineHeight: "AUTO"` for automatic (preferred) or `lineHeight: 22` for explicit spacing
