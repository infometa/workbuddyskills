# Documentation Update Command: Update Implementation Documentation

## Documentation Analysis

1. Review current documentation status:
   - Check `specs/implementation_status.md` for overall project status
   - Review implemented phase document (`specs/phase{N}_implementation_plan.md`)
   - Review `specs/flutter_structurizr_implementation_spec.md` and `specs/flutter_structurizr_implementation_spec_updated.md`
   - Review `specs/testing_plan.md` to ensure it is current given recent test passes, failures, and changes
   - Examine `CLAUDE.md` and `README.md` for project-wide documentation
   - Check for and document any new lessons learned or best practices in CLAUDE.md

2. Analyze implementation and testing results:
   - Review what was implemented in the last phase
   - Review testing results and coverage
   - Identify new best practices discovered during implementation
   - Note any implementation challenges and solutions
   - Cross-reference updated documentation with recent implementation and test results to ensure accuracy

   - Mark completed tasks with ✅ status
   - Update implementation percentages
   - Add detailed notes on implementation approach
   - Document any deviations from original plan with justification
   - Add new sections if needed (lessons learned, best practices)
   - Document specific implementation details for complex components
   - Include a summary of any new troubleshooting tips or workflow improvements discovered during the phase

2. Update implementation status document:
   - Update phase completion percentages
   - Add or update implementation status for components
   - Add notes on implementation approach and decisions
   - Document best practices discovered during implementation
   - Note any challenges overcome and solutions implemented

3. Update implementation specification documents:
   - Mark completed items with ✅ or strikethrough but preserve original requirements
   - Add notes on implementation details where appropriate
   - Add references to implemented files and classes
   - Update any implementation guidance based on experience

4. Update CLAUDE.md and README.md if necessary:
   - Add new best practices
